\begin{abstract}
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of sentiment classification on Trip Advisor reviews using 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. The study explores the effectiveness of these models 
in understanding and predicting sentiment from textual data. A detailed methodology, experimental setup, 
and results are provided, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. In particular,
given a rather small dataset of Trip Advisor reviews, the aim is to classify the sentiment of each review into both
stars classes (1 to 5 stars) and ternary classes (positive, negative, neutral). RNN models are implemented
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), while Transformers are implemented using the BERT architecture, in
particular the RoBERTa model. The results show that while Transformers require much less epochs to 
converge, RNNs are able to achieve better performance in terms of accuracy and F1 score on such
small dataset. On the other hand, Transformers show much better capabilities in terms of ambiguous reviews, 
achieving a better F1 score and accuracy in the middle part of the scale (3-4 stars).
